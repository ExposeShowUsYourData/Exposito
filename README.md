#### Data Collection story:
NICI leverages several open datasets (public and private) providing information on economic, demographic, environmental and social factors to assist potential investors, migrants and tourists with decision making. These include datasets such as:
• Stocktake of Australian Innovation Precincts to understand the potential opportunities for individuals and businesses in relation to viable relocation or investment options;
• Labour Markets Data to explore employment projections, internet job advertisements, labour market data like employment, unemployment, occupation and industry composition;
• ABS datasets such as Housing Affordability and Census data to understand social and demographic facts;
• Environmental datasets such as Water and Weather data to provide environmental insights; and
• Several other public and private data feeds such as LinkedIn, RP data, Traffic Volumes, to further enrich the information and services provided to the individual.

#### Going further than that!




### Datasets Used:

* PSMA Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF) - Department of Industry, Innovation and Science
https://data.gov.au/dataset/19432f89-dc3a-4ef3-b943-5326ef1dbecc/gmd G-NAF is one of the most ubiquitous and powerful spatial datasets. It contains more than 13 million Australian physical address records. The records include geocodes. These are latitude and longitude map coordinates. G-NAF does not contain any names or personal information.
Data is used for multipile locations of interest, from petrol stations, police stations through to schools and hospitals.  

* Contours - Geoscience Australia
http://services.ga.gov.au/gis/rest/services/NM_Relief_and_Physiography/MapServer Esri ArcGIS MapSever URL. The web map service portrays detailed graphic representation of features that appear on the Earth's surface. These features include the relief and physiography themes from the Geoscience Australia 250K Topographic Data.
Data is used to associate gradiant with landscape. This is important in predicting where water will flow next for large scale argicultural investments to be planned.


* Recent Air Quality - Environment Protection Authority (EPA) - South Australia
http://www.epa.sa.gov.au/air_quality/pi.txt RSS feed. TThe EPA’s recent air quality data is a RSS feed that includes hourly average pollutant concentrations for ozone (ppm), carbon monoxide (ppm), nitrogen dioxide (ppm), sulfur dioxide (ppm), particles (PM10) (μg/m3), fine particles (PM2.5) (μg/m3) and station index (station air quality index or AQI) for 13 EPA monitoring sites.
Used for determining safe environments or potential grower opportunities.


* Road Bridges and Fords - Geoscience Australia
http://services.ga.gov.au/gis/rest/services/NM_Transport_Infrastructure/MapServer Esri ArcGIS MapSever URL.
